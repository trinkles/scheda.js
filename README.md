scheda.js
=========

Draw a weeklong schedule using HTML5 canvas.

Extended to 11:00 PM.

Limitations/Issues:
- Lacks warning/prevention/error measures if user inputs from PM to AM time options
- Time range from 7AM to 11PM
- No Sundays
- Only used for creating own timetable, not for finding common availability with others
